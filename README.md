# QMK and VIA RGB Guide macOS

**0 responsibility on my part if you brick your board**

This guide is mostly for the peeps who want more customizability in configuring their qmk map, if you just want to change rgb with keycodes you can use the [qmk configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/gmmk/pro/ansi/LAYOUT).
